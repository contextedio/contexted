## Write, connect and visualize your notes 
Contexted makes writing notes and linking them together a bliss. Packed with features to write, connect and navigate your notes, Contexted enables you to transform your notes into personal knowledge . Each new note is part of your web of knowledge

Most curent note-taking app treat each note in isolation. Related notes can not be linked, making it hard to get an overview of how your notes are related. Each note feels as a start from scratch, isolated from all your previous work.
